## Last Week's Accomplishments

I improved the user interface of the product so that it is usable by a normal user. I also added some feature enhancements.

## This Week's Plan

Definitely add CSS support, because I found out through talking to a teacher that CSS is more confusing to students than HTML.

## Anything Blocking?

Hopefully I'll be able to write a CSS parser.

## Notes

I showed this to a teacher at my high school, and she gave me some suggestions.
